# OCP_Learning
Helpful Code Snippets and Study Guides to destroy the OCP Examp


## What do I need to study with?
- Java SE 11
- A Text Editor of your choice. Depending on your Java comfortability, if you know the syntax, just use an IDE. If not, try compiling it with just a test editor.
- Access to the CLI

### A note on binaries
Please use the Oracle JDK distribution. We are targeting taking the OCP exam, so we should use what Oracle uses for the exam. If you do not have access to this, then use the OpenJDK version of Java 11. Do a few Google searches and you'll figure out how to install it.
