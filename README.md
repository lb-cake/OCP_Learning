# OCP Learning
Helpful Code Snippets and Study Guides to destroy the OCP Exam


## What do I need to study with?
- Java SE 11
- A Text Editor...NOT an IDE
- Access to the CLI

### A note on binaries
Please use the Oracle JDK distribution. We are targeting taking the OCP exam, so we should use what Oracle uses for the exam. If you do not have access to this, then use the OpenJDK version of Java 11. Do a few Google searches and you'll figure out how to install it.

## How is this repo laid out?
Each chapter is seperated by a specific chapter. In that chapter are code snippets to
help explore the language, study questions, and finally a challenge to go along with each chapter.
